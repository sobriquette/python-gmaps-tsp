# python-gmaps-tsp
Leveraging Concorde TSP solver and data from Google Distance Matrix API to compute optimal routes

Exercise to learn how to:
1) Make requests to Google APIs
2) Use response data and known TSP (Traveling Salesman Problem) solvers to compute an optimal route through points
3) Integrate into a small Flask app with a form to submit waypoints
4) Display computed route in Flask app on Google Maps

AND (eventually), consider routes optimized for POI business hours.
